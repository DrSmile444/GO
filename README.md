# GO

## [**Play now!**](https://drsmile444.github.io/GO/)

> ### Classical GO-game. I develop the game during lessons :P

After 3000 years, I try to make this game a bit different style.<br>
More [info about game](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)>)!

# Features

- It's interesting!
- It's cool!
- It's amazing game!

Okay... I **just joke**..

- The game supports up to 10 players at a time (actually more..)
- Clear design and themes
- Good reason to spend your time with friends!

In the future (at next boring / empty lessons) I will add:

- A game-bot
- Network multiplayer
- More game settings and mods

Just give me a bit time... I hope I will not be expelled!

## - Why should I play exactly your game?

## **- Cause my game can handle more than two players, and that's cool!**
